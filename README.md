# batch3-wave1-test-solutions

This repo contains proposed solutions for the wave#1 admission test for batch3 of the LDSSA.

The test was done through [Stepik](https://stepik.org), which is an e-learning platform.
The test is now publicly available, but you still need a Stepik account to access it.

You can check the test (and it's questions) [here](https://stepik.org/course/53685).

This repo already has most of the relevant information, but it's still WIP :)
